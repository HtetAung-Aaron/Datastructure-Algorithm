brief example of DS  and algorithm
DS is created for storing or reusing data.. we need to use algorithms to put data into DS ..

binarysearch >> cut array in half and compare with mid number ** (sorted) **

linearsearch >> looping and finding number untill end of array ** (anything sorted or not) **

jumpsearch >> jump to the specific number and compare and use linear search ** (sorted) **
